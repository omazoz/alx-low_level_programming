# C - Preprocessor

 ## General objectives:
What are macros and how to use them
What are the most common predefined macros
How to include guard your header files

## Tests :

* [tests](./tests): Folder of test files. Provided by Holberton School.

## Tasks :

* **0.**
  * [0-object_like_macro.h](./0-object_like_macro.h): Header file that defines a
  macro named `SIZE` as an abbreviation for the token `1024`.

* **1.**
  * [1-pi.h](./1-pi.h): Header file that defines a macro named `PI` as an abbreviation
  for the token `3.14159265359`.

* **2.**
  * [2-main.c](./2-main.c): C program that prints the name of the file it was
  compiled from followed by a new line.

* **3.**
  * [3-function_like_macro.h](./3-function_like_macro.h): Header file that defines a
  function-like macro `ABS(x)` that computes the absolute value of a number `x`.

* **4.**
  * [4-sum.h](./4-sum.h): Header file that defines a function-like macro `SUM(x, y)`
  that computes the sum of the numbers `x` and `y`.
