# Low-Level Programming - Data Structures, Algorithms, Linux/Unix System Programming

This repository contains programs written for the low-level programming and algorithm track at ALX-Africa SE. In these projects, which  occurred throughout the duration of the Year 1 curriculum, I learned about data structures, algorithms, and other low-level programming concepts while working in the C language. The specific list of projects contained follows:

- [0x00](./0x00-hello_world): Hello, World.
- [0x01](./0x01-variables_if_else_while): Variables, if, else, while.
- [0x02](./0x02-functions_nested_loops): Functions nested loops.
- [0x03](./0x03-debugging): Debugging.
- [0x04](./0x04-more_functions_nested_loops): More functions, more nested loops.
- [0x05](./0x05-pointers_arrays_strings): Pointers, arrays, and strings.
- [0x06](./0x06-pointers_arrays_strings): More pointers, arrays, and strings.
- [0x07](./0x07-pointers_arrays_strings): Even more pointers, arrays, and strings.
- [0x08](./0x08-recursion): Recursion.
- [0x09](./0x09-static_libraries): Static libraries.
- [0x0A](./0x0A-argc_argv): Argc, argv.
- [0x0B](./0x0B-malloc_free): Malloc, free.
- [0x0C](./0x0C-more_malloc_free): More malloc, free.
- [0x0D](./0x0D-preprocessor): Preprocessor.
- [0x0E](./0x0E-structures_typedef): Structures, typedef.
- [0x0F](./0x0F-function_pointers): Function pointers.
- [0x10](./0x10-variadic_functions): Variadic functions.
- [0x11](https://github.com/4MR4N11/printf): Custom implementation of the printf function.
- [0x12](./0x12-singly_linked_lists): Singly linked lists.
- [0x13](./0x13-more_singly_linked_lists): More singly linked lists.
- [0x14](./0x14-bit_manipulation): Bit manipulation.
- [0x15](./0x15-file_io): File I/O.
- [0x16](https://github.com/4MR4N11/simple_shell): implement a simple UNIX command interpreter.
- [0x17](./0x17-doubly_linked_lists): Doubly linked lists.
- [0x18](./0x18-dynamic_libraries): Dynamic libraries.
- [0x19](https://github.com/4MR4N11/monty): Stacks, Queues - LIFO, FIFO.
- [0x1A](./0x1A-hash_tables): Hash tables.
- [0x1B](https://github.com/4MR4N11/sorting_algorithms): Sorting algorithms & Big O.
- [0x1C](./0x1C-makefiles): Makefiles.
- [0x1D](https://github.com/4MR4N11/binary_trees): Binary trees.
- [0x1E](./0x1E-search_algorithms): Search Algorithms.
