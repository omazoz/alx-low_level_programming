# Function pointers
Project  to learn about function pointers in **C language**.

* C files are compiled using `gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra -std=gnu89 `
* C files are written according to the C90 standard
* Tested on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS

## Files
All of the following files are programs written in C:



`0-print_name.c`  :Prints a name
`1-array_iterator.c` : Executes a function given as a parameter on each element of an array 
`2-int_index.c` : Searches for an integer 
`3-calc.h` : Header file that contains all function prototypes and data structures 
 arithmetic operations 
`3-get_op_func.c` : Function pointer that returns the pointer of the arithmetic functions 
`100-main_opcodes.c`:  Prints the opcodes of its own main function
